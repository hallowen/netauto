### Transceivers 

- GBIC is the older version of SFP
- SFP(Small Formfactor Pluggable)
	- SPF and SFP+ shares the same form factor.
	- SFP+: Supports 10G
	- Twinax cables have cables connected to SFP's on either ends which can be directly plugged into a switch. These are using Copper cables and hence lower cost.
	- QSPF+: Supports 40G.This has 4 10G steams which can be split into 4 no's of 10G using a breakout cable and connect them using Twinax cables. 
	- SFP28: This supports 25G and has the same formfactor as that of SPF and SFP+
	- QSFP28: Supports 100G, this can support 40G as well as 50G
- LR: Long Range
- SR: Short Range

### Connectivity Options

- Fiber connectivity
	- SR: OM3 or OM4 Multimod fiber. OM3 will support upto 70M whereas OM4 will support upto about 100M.
	- LR: These are used for longer cable runs. We can run upto 10 KM's.
- Twinax(DAC(Direct Attached Cables)): In this case SFP's are hardwired to a copper cable.
- AOC(Active Optical Cable): These are similar to Twinax. But in this case fiber cable is used.	

**Note: We need to consider active optical cable when there is EMI.
